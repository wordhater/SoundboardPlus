# SoundboardPlus
Allows a user to upload extra files for use in voice calls similar to discord's soundboard in voice calls.

## Important
**DO NOT USE ON LARGER DISCORD SERVERS WITH PEOPLE WHO YOU DONT KNOW OR TRUST. THERE IS PROBABLY SOME WAY USERS CAN MODIFY OTHER FILES ON THE HOST COMPUTER**

Requires ffmpeg to be installed

Will only run on linux due to differences in how ffmpeg is loaded

## To Do:
- Warn users if the bot is already playing sounds
- Youtube link support
- join vc that message author is not in
