# SoundboardPlus

Allows a user to upload extra files for use in voice calls similar to discord's soundboard in voice calls.

## Important

**DO NOT USE ON LARGER DISCORD SERVERS WITH PEOPLE WHO YOU DONT KNOW OR TRUST. THERE IS PROBABLY SOME WAY USERS CAN MODIFY OTHER FILES ON THE HOST COMPUTER**

Requires ffmpeg to be installed

## To Do

- Warn users if the bot is already playing sounds
- join vc that message author is not in

## Config.json

```json
{
    "TOKEN": "you bot token here",
    "FFMPEG_PATH": "enter the path to the ffmpeg binary (on linux if ffmpeg is installed from your package manager just enter ffmpeg)"
}
```
